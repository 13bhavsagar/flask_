    "\n",
    ">Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework written in Python, widely used for building web applications and APIs. It is based on the WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) standard and provides the essentials to get a web server running, without imposing a particular project structure or requiring heavy dependencies.Flask is especially popular for building APIs because of its simplicity, minimalism, and extensibility. It allows developers to create RESTful APIs quickly using just a few lines of code, while also giving the flexibility to scale and customize the application as needed. Features like built-in routing, JSON support, and easy integration with libraries such as SQLAlchemy, Marshmallow, and Flask-RESTful make it a favorite among developers for both small projects and large-scale microservices. Its excellent documentation and large community support further contribute to its popularity in API development."

GET requests can include query parameters in the URL, and they are generally considered safe and idempotent, meaning they don’t modify data and can be repeated without side effects. For example, fetching a user profile or listing products uses GET.\n",

    ">POST, on the other hand, is used to send data to the server to create or process a resource. POST requests include data in the request body and usually result in a change on the server, like creating a new user, submitting a form, or uploading a file. Unlike GET, POST requests are not idempotent—sending the same POST request multiple times can create multiple resources or trigger repeated actions."

    ">Flask APIs involves intercepting situations where the application cannot fulfill a client’s request as expected, and then returning clear, informative responses. Flask provides mechanisms to catch errors—such as missing resources or server failures—and map them to appropriate HTTP status codes like 404 (Not Found) or 500 (Internal Server Error). By defining error handlers, developers can customize these responses, often returning structured JSON messages that clients can understand and act upon. Additionally, Flask allows developers to explicitly trigger errors when certain conditions aren’t met, helping maintain robust and predictable API behavior. Overall, proper error handling in Flask ensures that APIs communicate problems gracefully, improving client experience and aiding debugging."

This abstraction simplifies database operations, allows for cleaner code, and supports multiple database backends by just changing configuration. The connection process involves configuring the app with database credentials, defining data models representing tables, and managing sessions that handle transactions safely."
